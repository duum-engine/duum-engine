## The duum engine
The duum engine is being made to make easier to make a game with the 90's doom style.

## Why C, glut, and openGL?
The reason is simple, literally, simplicity is our goal to make the best "minimal" engine that does one thing, but does it well.

> Glut 
It's simple, we do not have to link one hundred libraries before, and with few lines of code we can do the best.

> C 
Compile times way faster (and this really matters if it's a big project) and simplicity of course.

> OpenGL
Is faster than directX, and it have better APIs

## How to compile?
Make sure you have GLU, glut, openGL, headers in your system ad run
```./compile.sh```
